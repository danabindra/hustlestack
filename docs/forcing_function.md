# Research Sprint (Spike) Framework

## A 2-Week Discovery Process Before You Build Anything

-----

## What This Is

This is not a business plan. This is not a pitch deck. This is **reconnaissance work** that separates ideas from executable ventures.

**Your job over the next two weeks:** Prove to yourself (and me) that you understand the hardest parts of what you’re proposing to build.

-----

## Core Principle

> “Ideas are cheap. Constraint mapping is the craft.”

Every business idea sounds great until you meet reality. This sprint forces you to find reality before you waste months building the wrong thing.

-----

## The Deliverable

At the end of two weeks, you will present a **20-minute findings report** covering:

1. **The Five Hardest Problems** you will face (with evidence)
1. **What Already Exists** in this space (competitive landscape)
1. **What You Don’t Know Yet** (knowledge gaps you need to fill)
1. **The Unlock** - what would have to be true for this to work

-----

## Week 1: Discovery & Constraint Mapping

### Day 1-2: Define Your Core Assumption

Every business idea rests on assumptions. Write down your **one core assumption** that, if wrong, kills the entire venture.

**Examples:**

- “Hospitals will pay for AI triage tools”
- “Small businesses will outsource cybersecurity monitoring”
- “We can get access to the data we need”

**Your Task:**

- Write your core assumption at the top of a document
- Underneath, write: “This is true because…”
- Fill in 3-5 reasons you believe this

**Deliverable:** One paragraph stating your core assumption and why you believe it.

-----

### Day 3-5: Find What Already Exists

Someone has tried something like your idea before. Find them.

**Your Task:**

1. **Academic Research:** Search Google Scholar for papers related to your domain
- Health AI? Search: “emergency department triage AI”, “clinical decision support systems”
- Cybersecurity? Search: “managed security services small business”, “incident response automation”
1. **Industry Solutions:** Find 5-10 companies doing something adjacent
- Use Crunchbase, AngelList, Google
- Read their websites, blog posts, case studies
- Note: What do they offer? What do they charge? Who are their customers?
1. **Failure Analysis:** Find at least 2 companies that tried and failed/pivoted
- Search “[your industry] startup failed” or “why [solution] doesn’t work”
- Read post-mortems, LinkedIn posts from founders

**Deliverable:**

- A spreadsheet with 10 companies/projects (include: name, what they do, status, key learning)
- A 2-paragraph summary: “Here’s what I learned about what works and what doesn’t”

-----

### Day 6-7: Identify Your Five Hardest Problems

Based on what you’ve learned, list the **five hardest problems** you’ll face. Be specific.

**Not This:** “Getting customers will be hard”  
**This:** “Hospital procurement cycles are 18-24 months and require clinical validation studies that cost $200K+”

**Not This:** “Building the technology will be challenging”  
**This:** “HIPAA-compliant data storage adds $5K/month in infrastructure costs and requires a security audit before any hospital will pilot”

**Framework for Each Problem:**

1. **The Problem:** What specifically is hard?
1. **Why It Matters:** What breaks if you don’t solve this?
1. **Evidence:** How do you know this is actually a problem? (cite your research)
1. **Potential Paths:** What are 2-3 ways others have approached this?

**Deliverable:** Five problems written using the framework above (half-page per problem).

-----

## Week 2: Deep Dive & Knowledge Gaps

### Day 8-10: Pick ONE Problem and Go Deep

Choose the hardest problem from your list. Spend three days becoming a near-expert on it.

**Your Task:**

1. **Find the experts:** Who has solved this problem before?
- Read everything they’ve written
- Watch their conference talks
- Follow their LinkedIn/Twitter
1. **Map the landscape:**
- What technologies/approaches exist?
- What are the trade-offs between approaches?
- What’s considered “state of the art”?
1. **Find the data/tools:**
- What datasets exist? (for AI projects)
- What tools/platforms exist? (for technical projects)
- What do they cost? How do you access them?

**Deliverable:** A 2-page deep-dive document on this one problem. Include:

- Summary of the problem
- Current best approaches (with examples)
- Resources you’d need to solve it (data, tools, expertise, budget)
- Your assessment: “This is solvable because…” or “This is harder than I thought because…”

-----

### Day 11-12: Talk to Someone Who Knows

You cannot complete this sprint without talking to at least **one person** who actually works in your target domain.

**For Health AI:** A physician, nurse, hospital administrator, or health-tech founder  
**For Cybersecurity:** A CISO, IT director at an SMB, or MSP/MSSP operator

**How to Find Them:**

- LinkedIn (send thoughtful messages)
- Alumni networks
- Ask for introductions
- Attend industry meetups/webinars

**What to Ask:**

1. “I’m researching [problem]. What do you think is the hardest part of solving this?”
1. “What solutions have you tried? What worked? What didn’t?”
1. “If someone built [your solution], what would make you actually use it?”
1. “What am I not thinking about?”

**Deliverable:**

- Notes from your conversation
- 3 key insights you didn’t know before
- 1 thing that changed about your idea based on this conversation

-----

### Day 13-14: Synthesize & Present

Pull everything together into your final presentation.

**Presentation Structure (20 minutes):**

1. **The Idea (2 min)**
- What you’re proposing to build
- Your core assumption
1. **What Already Exists (4 min)**
- Competitive landscape summary
- What you learned from failure cases
1. **The Five Hardest Problems (8 min)**
- Present each problem with evidence
- Show you understand WHY each is hard
1. **The Deep Dive (3 min)**
- Your one problem that you went deep on
- What you learned, what surprised you
1. **What Would Have to Be True (3 min)**
- “For this to work, we would need…”
- Be honest about gaps in your knowledge/capability
- Proposed next steps: “Here’s what I need to learn/build/validate next”

**Deliverable:** Slide deck (10-15 slides max) or structured document

-----

## Evaluation Criteria

You’ll be assessed on:

1. **Intellectual Honesty:** Did you find real problems or sugarcoat things?
1. **Research Quality:** Did you dig beyond the first Google result?
1. **Evidence-Based Thinking:** Did you cite sources and data, or just opinions?
1. **Self-Awareness:** Can you articulate what you don’t know?
1. **Resourcefulness:** Did you find creative ways to get information?

**This is not about having all the answers.** It’s about proving you know how to find answers and that you understand the real complexity of what you’re proposing.

-----

## Domain-Specific Research Guides

### For Health-Tech / AI Projects

**Key Questions to Answer:**

- What data exists? How is it structured? How do you access it?
- What regulatory requirements apply? (FDA, HIPAA, state medical boards)
- Who makes purchasing decisions in your target customer? (hint: it’s rarely doctors)
- What clinical validation is required? What does that cost/take?
- What liability issues exist if your AI makes a wrong recommendation?

**Resources to Explore:**

- CMS Innovation Center projects
- NIH datasets (dbGaP, PubMed Central)
- FDA guidance on clinical decision support
- JAMIA, npj Digital Medicine (journals)
- Health-tech accelerator cohorts (Rock Health, Dreamit Health)

-----

### For Cybersecurity / MSP-MSSP Projects

**Key Questions to Answer:**

- What does an SMB actually pay for cybersecurity today?
- What tools/platforms would you use? What do they cost?
- What certifications/compliance do customers require? (SOC 2, ISO 27001, etc.)
- What’s your incident response playbook? (do you have one?)
- How do existing MSSPs price their services? What’s included?
- What’s the sales cycle? Who’s the buyer? (IT manager? CFO? Owner?)

**Resources to Explore:**

- Gartner Magic Quadrant for MSSPs
- SANS Institute resources
- MSP subreddits/forums (r/msp)
- SMB cybersecurity insurance requirements
- Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC)
- ConnectWise, Datto, Kaseya (platforms MSSPs use)

-----

## Final Note

If at the end of this sprint you realize your idea is harder than you thought, **that’s a success**. You just saved yourself six months.

If you come out more convinced than ever, **that’s also a success** - but now you’re convinced for the right reasons, with evidence.

The goal isn’t to discourage you. It’s to make you **dangerous** - someone who understands not just what to build, but how hard it will be and what it will really take.

Now go do the work.

**Questions?** Bring them to our check-in sessions. But the research is yours to own.
